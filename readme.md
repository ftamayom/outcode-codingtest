# Outcode Codingtest

Imagine your team has developed a web service that receives requests from about 20 million unique IP addresses every day. You want to keep track of the IP addresses that are making the most requests to your service each day. Your job is to write a program that (1) tracks these IP addresses in memory (donâ€™t use a database), and (2) returns the 100 most common IP addresses.
